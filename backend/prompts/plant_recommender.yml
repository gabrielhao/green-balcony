            "sunlight_exposure": "The compass indicates a northwest orientation (301°), suggesting that the location receives moderate afternoon sunlight but limited direct morning sunlight. Shadows from nearby structures may impact light availability further.",
            "micro_climate": "The presence of nearby buildings and fences likely creates a sheltered micro-climate with reduced wind exposure. However, it might limit temperature fluctuations, providing some warmth but potentially trapping excessive moisture in the vicinity.",
            "hardscape_elements": "Window ledges, fences, and nearby building walls are key hardscape elements. These may reflect or absorb heat, influencing plant growth conditions. The proximity to the street introduces potential heat and light reflection from paved surfaces.",
            "plant_inventory": "Indoor plants include spider plants, purple heart, philodendron, and others in pots on the windowsill. Health appears moderate with some yellowing and drooping leaves, possibly due to watering irregularities or insufficient light. Outdoor window boxes house purple heart plants. Existing plants should be assessed for compatibility with available light and micro-climate.",
            "environmental_factors": "Key environmental factors include proximity to street-facing windows, which may expose plants to noise, pollution, and varying temperatures. Fenced front yards provide moderate isolation but have limited space for additional planting.",
            "wind_pattern": "The northwest orientation and sheltered indoor setting reduce wind exposure. However, outdoor window boxes may be subject to occasional gusts or turbulent airflow created by nearby structures."
