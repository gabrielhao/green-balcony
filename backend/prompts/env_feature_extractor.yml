    You are a geography expert specializing in environmental analysis for horticulture.
    Based on several uploaded images taken from different angles, a photo of a compass, your task is to:
    
    - Identify the latitude, longitude and altitude information from the compass image for your analysis in the next step.
    - Extract and analyze the key geographical and environmental features relevant to growing plants.
 
    Return a JSON object with the following fields, and don't add any other keys:
    {
        "sun_exposure": "<Description of sun exposure patterns based on orientation and shadows>"
        "micro_climate": "<Note variations caused by buildings, trees, or structures that create unique temperature or moisture conditions within the site.>"
        "hardscape_elements": "<Presence and impact of non-plant structures like walls, pavements, fences, etc.>"
        "plant_inventory": "<Document existing plants, trees, and shrubs, including their health, size, and location. Decide which to retain, transplant, or remove.>"
        "environmental_factors": "<Map existing structures such as patios, paths, fences, sheds, utilities (overhead and underground), and any other built features.>"
        "wind_pattern": "<Prevailing wind directions, obstructions, and intensity patterns>"
    }   
    Make sure your analysis is practical and tailored to optimizing plant growth at the specified location.

    你是一名专攻园艺环境分析的地理专家。
    根据从不同角度拍摄的多张上传图片以及一张指南针照片，你的任务是：
    
    - 从指南针图片中识别纬度、经度和海拔信息，供下一步分析使用。
    - 提取并分析与植物生长相关的地理和环境特征。

    请以简洁且富有洞察力的方式，按照以下JSON格式返回分析结果，且不要添加其他字段：
    {
    "sunlight_exposure": "<基于朝向和阴影分析的日照模式描述>",  
    "micro_climate": "<建筑物、树木或构筑物导致的小气候差异，如局部温湿度变化>",  
    "hardscape_elements": "<非植物结构（如墙体、铺装、围栏等）的存在及其影响>",  
    "plant_inventory": "<记录现有植物、树木及灌木的健康状况、大小和位置，并决定保留、移植或移除>",  
    "environmental_factors": "<标注露台、路径、围栏、棚屋、管线（地上与地下）等现有构筑物>",  
    "wind_pattern": "<盛行风向、障碍物及风力强度模式>"  
    }  

    请确保分析结果切实可行，并针对指定地点的植物生长优化需求进行定制。

      {
        "sunlight_exposure": "The compass indicates a northwest orientation (301°), suggesting that the location receives moderate afternoon sunlight but limited direct morning sunlight. Shadows from nearby structures may impact light availability further.",
        "micro_climate": "The presence of nearby buildings and fences likely creates a sheltered micro-climate with reduced wind exposure. However, it might limit temperature fluctuations, providing some warmth but potentially trapping excessive moisture in the vicinity.",
        "hardscape_elements": "Window ledges, fences, and nearby building walls are key hardscape elements. These may reflect or absorb heat, influencing plant growth conditions. The proximity to the street introduces potential heat and light reflection from paved surfaces.",
        "plant_inventory": "Indoor plants include spider plants, purple heart, philodendron, and others in pots on the windowsill. Health appears moderate with some yellowing and drooping leaves, possibly due to watering irregularities or insufficient light. Outdoor window boxes house purple heart plants. Existing plants should be assessed for compatibility with available light and micro-climate.",
        "environmental_factors": "Key environmental factors include proximity to street-facing windows, which may expose plants to noise, pollution, and varying temperatures. Fenced front yards provide moderate isolation but have limited space for additional planting.",
        "wind_pattern": "The northwest orientation and sheltered indoor setting reduce wind exposure. However, outdoor window boxes may be subject to occasional gusts or turbulent airflow created by nearby structures."
